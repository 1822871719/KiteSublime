# Kite Python Assistant

Kite is an AI-powered programming assistant that helps you write Python code inside Sublime Text 3. The 
[Kite Engine](https://kite.com/) needs to be installed in order for the package to work properly. The package itself
provides the frontend that interfaces with the Kite Engine, which performs all the code analysis and machine learning.


## Features

Kite's goal is to help you write code faster by showing you the right information at the right time. At a high level,
Kite provides you with:
* üß† __Smart autocompletions__ powered by machine learning models trained on the entire open source code universe
* üëÄ __Advanced function signatures__ that show you not only the official signature of a function, but also the most 
popular ways other developers call the function
* üîç __Instant documentation__ for the symbol underneath your cursor
